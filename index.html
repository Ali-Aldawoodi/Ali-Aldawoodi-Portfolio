        <p id="me"> Hello! My name is Ali Aldawoodi and have a passion for coding. I never realized it and for most of
            my life until only a few months ago, never gave coding a shot. Well I am very glad that life has lead me to
            this point as i never knew or felt for sure about what purpose and contribution i could make for society.
            Now I do and am very glad to share it with you! </p>
