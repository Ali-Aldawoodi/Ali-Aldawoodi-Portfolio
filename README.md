# challenge-2

## Description
The attached website is my personal portfolio. I have created it to include one project that I have completed as well as four future projects that I plan to work on and create. I have designed the layout to include my work, how to contact me, and a picture of myself! This is all wrapped in a color scheme and box layout that I felt best represented myself.
