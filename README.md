# challenge-2

## Description
The attached website is my personal portfolio. I have created it to include two projects that I have completed as well as four future projects that I plan to work on and create. I have designed the layout to include my work, how to contact me, and a picture of myself! This is all wrapped in a color scheme and box layout that I felt best represented myself. Alos, user will be able to navigate pages via navigation bar at the top of the page. User will also be able to click the links in the footer at the bottom of the page at any time. User will be able to input information in the contact form.
