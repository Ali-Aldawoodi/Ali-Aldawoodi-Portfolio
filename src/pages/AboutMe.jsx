            <p id="me"> Hello! My name is Ali Aldawoodi and have a passion for coding. I never had realized it, and for most of
                my life never gave it a shot up until only a few months ago. Well I am very glad that life has lead me to
                this point as I never knew or felt for sure about what purpose and contribution I could make for society.
                Now I do and am very glad to share it with you! </p>
